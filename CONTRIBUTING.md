## Pull Request Requirements

- **Documentation Required:**
  - After opening a pull request for your node, you must also create documentation for your node and open a pull request for the same at the [DeForge-Labs/docs](https://github.com/DeForge-Labs/docs) repository.

This ensures that all nodes are well-documented and easy for others to use.
